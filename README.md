Course website for the requirements: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/human_grading/view/courses/973501/assessments/3/submissions


The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

>>> This project contains a single script called <<<

run_analysis.R
This script can take the data sets produced by an experiment collected from the accelerometers from smartphones and transform this in a clean dataset.

Here is an explanation how to run the script:

This script is to be put in the working directory folder [or set the working directory to the place where the script is saved].
The data-set is automatically downloaded [if not already present], and unzipped after.
Running the script will produce the .txt file containing the clean data.

The above mentioned operations might take up to several minutes, depending on your machine specifications!

Enjoy!
